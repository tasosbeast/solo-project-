                <p> Museum is an archaeological museum focused on the findings of the archaeological site of the Acropolis of Athens.
                 The museum was built to house every artifact found on the rock and on the surrounding slopes,
                  from the Greek Bronze Age to Roman and Byzantine Greece.
                   It also lies on the archaeological site of Makrygianni and the ruins of a part of Roman and early Byzantine Athens.

                    Made entirely of white marble, it's an impressive sight that's earned it the nickname Kallimarmaro or "beautiful marble"
